# Biomedical Image Analysis Portfolio

This repository is a curated **portfolio of biomedical image analysis projects** summarizing applied work in medical imaging,
with a focus on quantitative analysis, visualization, and deep learning–based image classification in biomedical imaging.


The projects included here highlight the **methods, skills, and tools applied**, including:
- Medical image preprocessing and visualization  
- Image segmentation and mask-based analysis  
- Quantitative feature extraction and biomarker measurement
- Deep learning and classical machine learning approaches for image analysis  
- Interpretation of results from real-world biomedical imaging datasets  

Each project is self-contained and documented with a dedicated README describing the problem, methodology, and key outcomes.

## Projects

### 1. Deep Learning–Driven Biomedical Image Analysis for Cell Classification

Deep learning–based image classification and hybrid modeling for complex biomedical image data.

This project presents an end-to-end pipeline for classifying biologically similar cell types from microscopy images. 
It combines convolutional neural networks with engineered chromatic features and classical machine learning to improve performance on overlapping classes.
