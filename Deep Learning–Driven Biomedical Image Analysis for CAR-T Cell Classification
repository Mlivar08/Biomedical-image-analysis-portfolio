#Automatic Classification of CAR-T Reactive Lymphocytes from Blood Smear Images

Master’s Thesis – Bioinformatics, Statistics & Machine Learning

This project presents an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for the automatic classification of lymphocyte subtypes from peripheral blood smear images, with a special focus on CAR-T reactive lymphocytes, a challenging and clinically relevant cell population emerging during CAR-T therapy.

The work combines convolutional neural networks, image segmentation, chromatic feature engineering, and hybrid machine learning models to improve classification performance in morphologically similar cell types.

##Problem & Motivation

During CAR-T therapy, reactive CAR-T lymphocytes appear in peripheral blood. These cells:

Exhibit high morphological variability

Strongly resemble normal and reactive lymphocytes

Are difficult to distinguish even for trained specialists

Accurate identification of these cells is important for therapy monitoring and outcome assessment, but manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective.

This thesis addresses this challenge through automated image analysis and deep learning.

##Dataset

Images: Peripheral blood smear images acquired using CellaVision® systems

Patients: 57 CAR-T patients + 33 non-CAR-T controls

Classes:

CAR-T reactive lymphocytes

Reactive classical lymphocytes

Normal lymphocytes

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts

Data preprocessing:

Cell-level cropping

Background noise reduction

Image normalization (ImageNet standards)


##Deep Learning Image Classification

Architecture: ResNet-152

Task: Multiclass classification of lymphocyte types

Training strategy:

Transfer learning

Fine-tuning with low learning rate

Early stopping and validation monitoring

Key outcome:

Strong performance despite high inter-class similarity

##Image Segmentation

Model tested: Segment Anything Model (SAM)

Goal: Nucleus and cytoplasm segmentation

Finding:

SAM performed poorly on small, low-contrast cellular structures

Highlighted the importance of domain-specific segmentation strategies

##Chromatic Feature Extraction

Extraction of color descriptors from:

RGB

HSV

LAB color spaces

Analysis revealed:

Strong chromatic differences for blasts and normal lymphocytes

Significant overlap for CAR-T and reactive lymphocytes

##Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization

UMAP applied to chromatic features

Used to:

Explore class separability

Detect feature redundancy

Improve interpretability of learned patterns

##Hybrid Model (Late Fusion)

Inputs combined:

CNN output probabilities

UMAP-reduced chromatic descriptors

Classifier: SVM with RBF kernel

Result:

Improved clustering

Better performance in under-represented and overlapping classes

##Results

Final model performance:

Overall accuracy: 96%

CAR-T recall: 93%

Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): 0.96

The hybrid CNN + chromatic feature approach outperformed the CNN alone

Demonstrated the value of combining deep representations with engineered features
